## **Amazon EC2**
+ EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS offering 
+ EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
+ It mainly consists in the capability of :
    + Renting virtual machines (EC2)
    + Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
    + Distributing load across machines (ELB)
    + Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
+ Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

#### EC2 sizing & configuration options
+ Operating System (**OS**): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
+ How much compute power & cores (**CPU**)
+ How much random-access memory (**RAM**)
+ How much storage space:
    + Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
    + hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
+ Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
+ Firewall rules: **security group**
+ Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

#### EC2 User Data
+ It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
+ bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
+ That script is only run once at the instance first start
+ EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
    + Installing updates
    + Installing software
    + Downloading common files from the internet
    + Anything you can think of
+ The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user
    
    ##### Example of scripts
    ```shell scripts
    #1/bin/bash
    # Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
    # install httpd (Linux 2 version)
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install -y httpd
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
    sudo chmod a+w /var/www/html
    sudo echo "<h1>Hello Welcome, $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    
    ```
## EC2 Instance Types - Overview
 + You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for 
different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

 + AWS has the following naming convention:
    > m5.2xlarge
 + m: instance class
 + 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)   
 + 2xlarge: size within the instance class

## EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose
+ Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
+ Balance between:
    + Compute
    + Memory
    + Networking
+ In the course, we will be using the t2.micro which is a General Purpose EC2 
instance

## EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized
+ Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance 
processors:
    + Batch processing workloads
    + Media transcoding
    + High performance web servers
    + High performance computing (HPC)
    + Scientific modeling & machine learning
    + Dedicated gaming servers

## EC2 Instance Types – Memory Optimized
+ • Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
+ Use cases: 
    + High performance, relational/non-relational databases
    + Distributed web scale cache stores
    + In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
    + Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

## EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized
+ Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write 
access to large data sets on local storage
+ Use cases:
    + High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
    + Relational & NoSQL databases
    + Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
    + Data warehousing applications
    + Distributed file systems
### EC2 Instance Types: example
| Instance    | vCPU | Mem (GiB) | Storage          | Network Performance | EBS Bandwidth (Mbps) |
|-------------|------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| t2.micro    | 1    | 1         | EBS-Only         | Low to Moderate     |                      |
| t2.xlarge   | 4    | 16        | EBS-Only         | Moderate            |                      |
| c5d.4xlarge | 16   | 32        | 1 x 400 NVMe SSD | Up to 10 Gbps       | 4,750                |
| r5.16xlarge | 64   | 512       | EBS-Only         | 20 Gbps             | 13,600               |
| m5.8xlarge  | 32   | 128       | EBS-Only         | 10 Gbps             | 6,800                |

> t2.micro is part of the AWS free tier (up to 750 hours per month)

# Introduction to Security Groups
+ Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
+ They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
![Security Groups](https://github.com/AvinashSharma1/aws-solutions-architect-associate-SAA-C03-notes/blob/master/Security%20Groups/Security%20Groups.PNG?raw=true "Security Groups")
+ Security groups only contain rules
+ Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
